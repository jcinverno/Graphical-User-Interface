# Graphical-User-Interface
These are some of the GUIs I've built using Object Oriented Programing and Tkinter. 

<b>State_Of_US:</b> It starts with an empty US map. A message box will appear in which you can enter the name of a state. The state's name will appear on the corresponding state. You must locate all of the states in the United States. You are allowed three incorrect guesses.

<b>Water_Marking:</b> The application asks for an image, which it then outputs with the text and color you specify.

<b>Type_Speed_Test:</b> A Tkinter GUI desktop application that tests your typing speed.

<b>Password_Manager:</b> A Tkinter GUI program that keeps a text file with all of your passwords. It can automatically generate new passwords or provide the written password for a specific login.
